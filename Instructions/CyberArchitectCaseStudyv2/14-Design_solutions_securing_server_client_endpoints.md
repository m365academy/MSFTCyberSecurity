This case study exercise is designed to provide experience performing some conceptual design tasks that relate to the subjects learned in this module.

## Case study: Create a remote access and endpoint strategy

Tailwind Traders is a fictitious home improvement retailer. It operates retail hardware stores across the globe and online. The Tailwind Traders CISO is aware of the opportunities offered by Azure, but also understands the need for strong security and solid cloud architecture. Without strong security and a great point of reference architecture, the company may have difficulty managing the Azure environment and costs, which are hard to track and control. The CISO is interested in understanding how Azure manages and enforces security standards.

### Requirements: remote access

The new CIO wants to ensure remote workers can connect to cloud resources without having to expose management ports on their cloud workloads and that remote branch offices can stay always connected with company's headquarter.

The CISO understands that in the current threat landscape, most of the attacks are targeting the endpoints. He needs to establish a new security baseline to harden all endpoints and provide a seamless experience to deploy these baselines across the clients. The CISO also wants to empower the SOC Team to perform investigations on the endpoints to better understand the root cause of an attack.

### Design tasks

* **Remote access**: 
     - Which solution should you use to enable the CIO vision regarding the connectivity for remote workers?
     - Which solution should you use for the remote branches?
* **Endpoint strategy**:
     - Which tool should you use to deploy the security baseline?
     - How can you enable the SOC Team to perform investigation of the endpoints?
