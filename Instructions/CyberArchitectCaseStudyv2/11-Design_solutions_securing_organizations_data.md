## Case study: Design solutions for securing an organizations data

Tailwind Traders is a fictitious home improvement retailer. It operates retail hardware stores across the globe and online. The Tailwind Traders CISO is aware of the opportunities offered by Azure, but also understands the need for strong security and solid cloud architecture. Without strong security and a great point of reference architecture, the company may have difficulty managing the Azure environment and costs, which are hard to track and control. The CISO is interested in understanding how Azure manages and enforces security standards.

### Requirements

Tailwind Traders plans to make some significant changes to their data
security strategy. The company has a new security optimization project for customer environments. The CISO wants to ensure that all data in rest and transit are secured and controlled in the cloud.
