## Case study: Design solutions for security posture management in hybrid and multi-cloud environments

Tailwind Traders is a modern commerce company. For more than 30 years,
the company has been a popular retail destination. It has grown to more
than 50 physical stores. Several years ago, its chief executive officer
(CEO) anticipated changes in retail and bought a competing e-commerce
start-up that was growing aggressively in niche markets. Today, the
company is seen as an innovative leader with customer-focused local
storefronts.

### Requirements

The new Chief Information Officer (CIO) is concerned with the rise of high-profile companies getting
compromised and asked the CSO to perform a risk assessment to identify
the companies' most valuable assets and ensure that they're secure. In addition, the
CIO wants the CSO to track security posture enhancement overtime and
use cyber-threat intelligence to improve their defenses against
threats. The CIO wants to have a monthly meeting to track this progress
and the CSO should present a sort of KPI to show how the company is
progressing. This is the first transformation effort to start since the
new CIO accepted the role. The CIO will closely monitor the project and
will examine how IT operates in the cloud.

### Design tasks

* Evaluate security posture
    - In this scenario, should the company track progress using Azure Security Benchmark or Secure Score? Justify your answer.
    - What tool should the CISO adopt to track progress overtime?
* Threat intelligence
    - Which tool should be utilized to aggregate CTI feeds and present in a meaningful dashboard?
    - Which tool provides built-in threat intelligence report that can be used to improve the companies' defenses?
* Which security capability will enable Tailwind Traders to implement the CIO's vision of empowering the remote users while enforcing security and restrictions based on the user's geo-location?
